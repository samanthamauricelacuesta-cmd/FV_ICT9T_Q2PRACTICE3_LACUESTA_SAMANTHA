                    <span class="lead fw-bold">Scott Pilgrim</span>, a directionless bassist, falls for the mysterious <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">Ramona Flowers</span>—but to date her, he must defeat her <span class="text-decoration-underline">seven evil exes</span>. Each battle forces Scott to confront not just Ramona’s past, but his own immaturity and guilt. Ramona struggles with emotional baggage, while exes like <span class="">Roxxy Richter</span> symbolize unresolved heartbreak. In the end, Scott earns the Power of Self-Respect, learning that <span class="text-capitalize"> love requires growth, honesty, and accountability.</span>

                        <td>Scott Pilgrim is the so called "protagonist" of the story. As it follows that he is an adult unwilling to grow up. He goes through struggles like responsibility or any trait that an adult carries. With this, he makes many mistakes unintentionally. We often forget or as the story sugar coats his mistakes percieving him as the "good guy" or the "victim". Though when we thoroughly analyze his character, he also has his faults and the unreliable narrator of the story. </td>

                        <td>Ramona Flowers is the love interest of Scott Pilgrim. Just like Scott Pilgrim, she also has her faults and she is more of the "indie grunge" type who is very mysterious. She has many unclosed relationships called the "seven evil exes". In which those people are the ones who were a victim to her actions due to her unhealthy habit of leaving no proper closure in her relationships. Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers are both the protagonist of the story but they are not the heroes but they are two people resolving and learning from their mistakes.</td>

                        <td>Roxxy Richter is a part of the "seven evil exes" of Ramona Flowers. What makes her interesting for me is that in the series, she validates the "seven evil exes" throughout the story. She shows her hurt and that the "seven evil exes" were only people who needed closure and the amount of mental damage Ramona Flowers can do. In which helped Ramona gain self awareness and learn from her mistakes</td>
